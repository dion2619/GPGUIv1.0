GPGUI (General purpose graphical user interface)

This arduino library is for a custom pcb based around a ESP32 microcontroller that can be used as a graphical control system for any device over a UART port. Also there is a basic raycasting engine that will render a map defined in two buffers. Also has a basic real time 3D vertex and triangle mesh rendering pipeline.
